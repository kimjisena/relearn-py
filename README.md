# Re-Learning Python (Since it's everywhere)

Hello and welcome to this repository. I started my programming journey with python. After 2 years of programming and learning other languages such as C and JavaScript, I feel like I should revisit Python again now that I know what programming is.

I'll be using [Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming]() by Eric Matthes.
